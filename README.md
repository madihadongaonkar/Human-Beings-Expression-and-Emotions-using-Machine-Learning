# Human-Beings-Expression-and-Emotions-using-Machine-Learning

The face is one of the easiest ways to distinguish the individual identity of each other. Face recognition is a personal identification system that uses personal characteristics of a person to identify the person's identity. Human face recognition procedure basically consists of two phases, namely face detection, where this process takes place very rapidly in humans, except under conditions where the object is located at a short distance away, the next is the introduction, which recognize a face as individuals. 


Problem formulation of our project:

![face2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30971726/103528607-41c88800-4eaa-11eb-8a2b-bccbd012563d.jpg)



classification, the algorithm attempts to classify the given faces portraying one of the seven basic emotions.

 Functional Requirements:
The functional requirements for a system describe what the system should do.Those requirements depend on the type of software being developed, the expected users of the software. These are statement of services the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs and how the system should behave in particular situation.
Face Detection:- Face detection is useful in detection of facial image. Face detection is carried out in training Dataset using Haar classifier Voila-Jones face detector and implement through the openCv. Haar like features encodes the difference average intensity in different parts of the image and consist of black and white connected rectangles in which the value of the feature is the difference of sum of pixel values in black and white regions.
Feature Extraction:- Selection of the feature vectors are the most important part in pattern classification problem. The image of face after pre-processing is then used for extracting the important feature. The inherent problems related to image classification includes the scale, pose, translation and variation in illumination level
